## Classpack

The classpack contains everything you need to complete the assignments, including PCap files to analyze, and some plugins/utilities for better Wiresharkin'! It's too much to commit to Github, but you'll find all the raw data in our class folder.

Each commit is signed by me (see [my manifest for my public key](https://gist.github.com/harlo/4c4628b82f57d61168e8f9ba4552940d)). Further, here's the SHA256 hash of what you'll need to get started.

If it's taking too long to download the classpack, I will come bearing USB keys with the same material. We all know the risks of sharing USB keys, so caveat emptor, but also YOLO!
